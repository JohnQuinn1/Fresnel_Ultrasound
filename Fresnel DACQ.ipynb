    "### Raspberry Pi Pico\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) is a microcontroller that runs [Micropython](https://micropython.org). \n",
    "\n",
    "A limit switch is installed at one end of the slider rail, which is used to set the home zero position of the slider and prevent the motor driving too far. The limit is implemented in the software installed on the Pi Pico - for safety reasons you should only use the supplied functions and not directly manipulate the motor. The limit at the opposite end is based on a maximum number of steps from the limit switch. At any point the limit switch can be pressed by hand to stop the motor moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to control the motor is installed in a file called `main.py` which is executed when the Pi Pico boots up. One can interact directly with the Pi Pico using the Thonny program and execute MicroPython commands including the functions to move the motor defined in `main.py`. However, for the purpose of automating the experiment, we want to issue commands to the Pi Pico directly from Python running on a standard PC. The is achieved by sending commands and receiving responses over the USB connection using PySerial. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A class (`PicoSerial`) is provided in this GitHub repository to facilitate easy communication with the Pi Pico.\n",
    "The serial over USB approach uses the Pi Pico's REPL mode (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) where commands received by the Pi Pico are read and echod to the terminal (serial line), evaluated, answer printed, and then repeat.\n",
    "This means that prompts seen in the terminal in Thonny ('`>>>`') are included and must be handled. Also, Python strings must be encoded as UTF8 for sending and decoded from UTF8 for receiving - this is handled automatically by the `PicoSerial` class. Sample code for doing this is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an issue with timing - to read blocks of text a timeout must be specified and  if a command takes longer than the timeout (default is 1 s) to execute on the Pi Pico then a black line is returned and a re-read must happen. The PicoSerial class has a function which re-reads until a non-empty response is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: sometimes the Pi Pico needs to be re-started after using Thonny so that it can communicate with the PC using Python and PySerial. If you need to restart it you must turn off the power to the power supply and also disconnect the USB cable from the computer.  "
